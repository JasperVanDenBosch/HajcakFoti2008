    In every trial you will see two colored cards displayed. 
    The cards are selected from four decks; blue, green, purple and red. 
    Your task is to select one of the two cards, 
    by pressing F for the left card, and J for the right card.
    After selecting a card, you will see how much you won or lost, 
    and how much you would have won or lost if you had chosen the other card. 
    Use any strategy you want to help you maximize your points total.

    There will be 15 blocks of 32 trials each. 
    At the end of each block you will see an update of your winnings up to that point.
    You will keep whatever money you won playing the game, in addition to your course credits.
